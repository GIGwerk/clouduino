The mesh library of ESP8266 Core for Arduino (v2.4.0) is under very active development at the moment. As of September 2018, the mesh library can't mesh properly, wherein the messages does not multihop but can directly communicate with immediate nodes. Hence for now, Painless mesh library by  will be used as sample sketch for demonstrating mesh networking with Clouduino.
