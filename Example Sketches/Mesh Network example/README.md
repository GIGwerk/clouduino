The mesh library of ESP8266 Core for Arduino (v2.4.0) is under very active development at the moment. As of September 2018, the mesh library still can't mesh properly. That is - although messages can directly be exchanged with immediate nodes, messages cannot multihop to other nodes. Hence for now, Painless mesh library will be used just as a placeholder sample sketch for demonstrating mesh networking with Clouduino.

A working Mesh library is underway.
